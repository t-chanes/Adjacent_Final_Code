Final code for the adjacent game
This is a game where the objective is to turn all of the blocks black. By clicking on a white block the surrounding blocks turn black.

**Before using this code please ensure that you have the proper java version installed (jdk 1.8), JavaFX installed, and Scenebuilder installed properly**
Everything in this game works properly and as intended.

To import this code into Eclipse, open an Eclipse workspace. Then, right click and select import. You will then click on the option that says "Git" and "Projects from Git"
If done correctly it should ask for a repository source. Select "clone URI" and paste this link "https://github.com/t-chanes/Adjacent_Final_Code.git"
The next screen should be the branch selection screen. Select the "master" branch only.
Keep clicking next until you reach the screen that says "Wizard for project import". Here, select import as a general project and then select next.
The code should then be successfully downloaded! To run the code just click the green play button on the top of Eclipse.
